# YShield: AI-Driven Autonomous Security Defense System

**[README中文版](README-zh.md)**
 
## Project Introduction

`YShield` (pronounced "Yu Zhi" in Chinese, meaning "Foreknowledge" or "Pre-cognition") is an innovative, AI-driven autonomous security defense system designed to provide enterprises with a next-generation, closed-loop security posture. Moving beyond traditional rule-based and human-centric security operations, `yshield` leverages advanced Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Big Data technologies to achieve autonomous learning, autonomous decision-making, and autonomous response capabilities. Its core mission is to enable proactive threat prediction, automated remediation, and continuous evolution, ensuring a "prescient and tireless" defense against modern cyber threats.

## Customer Pain Points and Value Proposition

Traditional security solutions often fall short in the face of increasingly sophisticated and automated cyberattacks, particularly those driven by AI. Many organizations, especially SMEs, lack 24/7 Security Operations Centers (SOCs), leading to reactive responses, missed alerts, and high false-positive rates. `yshield` directly addresses these critical challenges:

### 1. Insufficient Intelligent Threat Insight & Prediction
*   **Pain Point:** Enterprises are often unaware of their full attack surface and potential vulnerabilities, only reacting after an incident occurs.
*   **Value (CTEM Engine):** `yshield` continuously simulates attacks and conducts red-teaming exercises using AI to model attacker paths (e.g., APT kill chains). It identifies potential attack surfaces, prioritizes critical assets by correlating vulnerability risks with business importance, and helps clients achieve closed-loop risk management.

### 2. Challenges in Anomaly Detection & Real-time Analysis
*   **Pain Point:** Traditional signature- or threshold-based detection methods are ineffective against zero-day exploits and unknown threats, with high rule maintenance costs.
*   **Value (AI-Driven Anomaly Detection):** `yshield` employs User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) and Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) models to detect real-time deviations from baseline behaviors. By correlating multi-source data (logs, network traffic, endpoint telemetry) via deep learning models, it significantly reduces false positives and negatives.

### 3. Lack of Automated Remediation & Self-learning Response
*   **Pain Point:** Security teams are often understaffed, overwhelmed by alerts, and manual remediation is time-consuming and error-prone.
*   **Value (Autonomous Decision & Response Hub):** Upon detecting high-confidence threats, `yshield`'s AI hub autonomously decides and executes response actions based on predefined policies and real-time risk assessments (e.g., host isolation, IP blocking, malicious change rollback, virtual patching). It continuously refines its decision-making strategies through a feedback loop, becoming "smarter with use."

### 4. Insufficient Continuous Evolution & Security Knowledge Accumulation
*   **Pain Point:** Most security products have long update cycles, failing to rapidly incorporate the latest threat intelligence and models, leading to security blind spots.
*   **Value (Security Knowledge Graph & Evolutionary Learning):** `yshield` builds an enterprise-grade security knowledge graph, continuously collecting public threat intelligence (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK, CVEs, industry darknet intelligence) and integrating new information into its models. It automatically updates the knowledge graph and model parameters based on internal detection logs and remediation outcomes, ensuring continuous improvement of defense capabilities.

## Key Features

*   **Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM):** Proactive attack surface assessment, vulnerability prioritization, and simulated attack path analysis.
*   **AI-Driven Multi-Source Anomaly Detection:** Leverages UEBA, NTA, and deep learning on logs, network traffic, and endpoint data for advanced threat detection.
*   **Autonomous Decision & Response:** AI-powered automated remediation actions, including host isolation, IP blocking, virtual patching, and malicious change rollback.
*   **Dynamic Security Knowledge Graph:** Real-time ingestion and correlation of threat intelligence, vulnerabilities, and internal security events for enhanced context.
*   **Evolutionary Learning Module:** Continuous model refinement and policy adaptation based on feedback loops and new threat landscapes.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):** Provides insights into AI's decision-making process for transparency and auditing.
*   **Comprehensive Observability:** Integrated logging, metrics, and tracing for full system visibility.
*   **Intuitive Visualization & Dashboards:** Centralized security dashboard for key metrics, attack surface maps, and alert management.
*   **Compliance Reporting:** Supports generating audit-ready reports for various industry standards.
